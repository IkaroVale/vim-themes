# Dusklight — A Vim Colorscheme Based on Alduin

**Dusklight** is my personal customization of [Alduin](https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin) by Alessandro Yorba — a medieval, dark, low-saturation colorscheme for Vim. I loved the atmosphere of Alduin, but I needed better readability and more color saturation for modern screens and long coding sessions.

This project is both a learning experience and a functional theme. I've created custom highlight overrides specifically for Python, Java, and Vim syntax.

## About the name "dusklight"

"Dusklight" aims to keep Alduin’s Tolkien-esque, moody village vibe, something like 'Middle-earth' — but with **brighter magical accents** and **clearer syntax visibility**.
